# stm32-debug

This repository contains a collection of OpenOCD configuration files, and SVD files for STM32 microprocessors.  These were originally extracted from a Linux installation of STM32CubeIDE v1.14.0.  Rather than install that (large) tool, this repo can be cloned to get access to these files.
