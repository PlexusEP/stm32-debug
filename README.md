# stm32-svd

This repository contains a collection of PLXS-tested SVD files for STM32 microprocessors.

Note that STM32CubeIde, STM32CubeProgrammer, and STM32CubeCLT all come with SVD files as part of those separate installation packages.  However, some of those SVD files are invalid.  This is well-documented on the Internet, and is also the reason repositories such as [this one](https://github.com/tinygo-org/stm32-svd) already exist.

When Plexus projects come along that use an STM32 microprocessor that don't already have an SVD file in this repo, those teams are encouraged (through the Engineering Productivity team or otherwise) to contribute a know-good SVD.
